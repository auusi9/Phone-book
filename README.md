### Architecture ###

* Project has been made using the MVC pattern.
* The views communicate with the controllers via actions. Each controller + action represent a use case. 
* Controllers know about the models interface and about external services via adapters (in this case persistance service).
* Once the data of the models changes, it notificates to the view its changes. 

* This project uses Zenject to solve the dependency injection. Also uses Zenject's signal bus to fire actions and notifications. (https://github.com/svermeulen/Extenject)
* Contact list is a pool, it uses LoopScrollRect an open source pooling system for Unity's scroll rect (https://github.com/qiankanglai/LoopScrollRect) I extended the functionality of the plugin to make it work with Zenject's own pooling system.
